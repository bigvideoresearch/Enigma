### Overview of WSL
We introduce Self-Contained Confidence (SCC) by adapting model uncertainty for WSL setting, and use it to sample-wisely balance the self-label supervised loss and the webly supervised loss. Therefore, a simple yet effective WSL framework is proposed.

The paper has been accepted by ECCV 2020. For more details, please refer to our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.11894).

## Getting started
#### Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Preparation

Put this git repository in a root directory. And in the root directory, run

```train
mkdir checkpoint
mkdir data
mkdir imglists
```

The experiments used Food101 and WebVision datasets.

You can download the image list files in the imglists folder for reading datasets here:

- [Image Lists](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eg5alvrQh8Fvf48mfbR4QM0AUqiBNleX/view?usp=sharing)



### Training and Evaluation

To run the baseline in the paper, run this command:

```train
sh ./scripts/WSL/food101n/base.sh
```
To run the SCC in the paper, run this command:

```train
sh ./scripts/WSL/food101n/offline_scc.sh
```

### Pre-trained Models

You can download pretrained models here:

- [Trained models](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17w2aIyIc79_oyzeexh6vrmG6v3G-XDWT/view?usp=sharing)

### Results

Our model achieves the following performance on Food101N dataset:

| Model name         | Top 1 Accuracy  | Top 5 Accuracy |
| ------------------ |---------------- | -------------- |
| baseline               |     83.66%         |      94.97%       |
| offline scc   |     86.44%         |      96.77%       |

Our model achieves the following performance on Google500 dataset:

| Model name         | Top 1 Accuracy  | Top 5 Accuracy |
| ------------------ |---------------- | -------------- |
| baseline               |     68.31%         |      82.12%       |
| offline scc   |     69.16%         |      82.66%       |
